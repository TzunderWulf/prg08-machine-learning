                <h2>Week 1 - Teachable Machine</h2>
                <p>
                    First week assignment, working with Teachable Machine from Google. Very simple example, based on
                    the hand sign you give, it responds in text. The model is very buggy, due to a lack of data it 
                    could train of.

                <h2>Week 2.1 - Pre-trained model with ML5.js</h2>
                <p>
                    Second week we started working with ML5.js. The first steps with ML5.js was working with a pre-trained
                    model. You give it an image, and it gives several results back. The results tend to not be accurate, but
                    it gives some funny answers.

                <h2>Week 2.2 - Training your own model</h2>
                <p>
                    Besides working with a pre-trained model, we also needed to train our own model. We do this by taking a bunch
                    of pictures of a certain data (like wearing a mask or not). Then let it train and predict if we are wearing 
                    a mask or not.
